--------Time Quantum Experiment--------
    To run the time quantum experiment, you need to invoke the bash script "run_tquantum_simulation.sh":
        ./run_tquantum_simulation.sh
    After fully executing it will output the response time and turnaround time plots with the minima of both marked as well as a file called quantum.txt indicating what the most optimal time quantum is.
    Warning: Run time is extremely long.

--------Main Experiment--------
    To run the main experiment, you need to invoke the bash script "run_main_simulation.sh":
        ./run_main_simulation.sh
    After fully executing it will output the response time, turnaround time, waiting time, throughput and CPU utilization distributional plots as well as the mean and median bar plots for each metric.
    Warning: Run time is long as well.
